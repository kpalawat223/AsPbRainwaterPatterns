## Title
Patterns of contamination and burden of lead and arsenic in rooftop harvested rainwater collected in Arizona environmental justice communities

### Description and Data Access
This repository includes community generated data from the University of Arizona's Project Harvest in partnership with the Sonora Environmental Research Institute (SERI).

Based on survey responses, 12 participants did not feel comfortable with their data shared publicly. To protect participant privacy and respect data ethics guidelines, a total of 99 samples were excluded from this database. All samples were anonymized by deidentifying sample IDs and sites. 

### Contents
SupplementalFile1.xlsx describe raw and corrected concentrations of dissolved arsenic (As) and lead (Pb) concentrations in Project Harvest (PH) rooftop harvested rainwater from Arizona environmental justice communities and National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) wet-only deposition rainwater samples from around Arizona.

SupplementalFile2.R provides code to correct the raw concentration data.

SupplementalFile3.R provides example linear mixed models.
